Note per file

1-Biomass.R
  Containts the scripts for the raw biomass values which includes bacteria and fungi
  Script was used to subset the data by organism (bacteria vs fungi) and once again by treatment bacteria 
     burned vs. bacteria unburned and fungi burned vs. fungi unburned
  Multiple graphs were created here to visualize the data and see patterns. Final graphs are located 
     in script "3-Biomass-Graphs-Barplot-Ash-Precip.R"
     
2-Biomass-Bacteria-FullMod-SigNif and 2-Biomass-Fungi-FullMod-SigNif
  Model selections (nestedness level) and model type (neg binomial selection) are included 
  Process also includes the backward model selection including variabes of interest and their interactions
  
  
3-Biomass-Graphs-Barplot-Ash-Precip
  Final graphs (before merging to match the panels in the article)
  Graphs include barplot graphs between treatment, time since fire graphs (time, ashdepth and biomass) and 
  dual axis graph of bacteria and fungi with precipitation over time.
